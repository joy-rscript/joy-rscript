👋 Hey there, I’m Joy Ruvimbo!
Welcome to my corner of the internet, where ideas meet code and bugs meet… well, hopefully, fixes. 🐛➡️✨

I’m a curious Software Engineer who loves turning complex problems into elegant (and sometimes quirky) solutions. Whether I’m working on the cloud, crafting user-friendly apps, or diving into deep learning, I’m all about building tech that works and wows.

🌟 About Me:
🛠️ Code Connoisseur: I’ve dabbled in a bit of everything—building responsive apps, tweaking financial dashboards, and making sure cloud setups stay solid and scalable.
🌩️ Cloud Wrangler: I design and optimize cloud systems that are reliable, cost-friendly, and ready for the next big thing.
🤖 Machine Learner: From training AI models to spot sensitive info to debugging why it suddenly thinks cats are chairs, I’m here for the challenge.
🎮 Playful Developer: Once built a 3D combat game and spent hours debugging why objects wouldn’t collide, only to realize the culprit was a missing checkbox in Unity’s inspector.



🔭 Currently...
🌩️ Mastering Cloud: Balancing GCP and AWS to become a pro at picking the right tools for the job.
⚙️ Web Development: balancing backend and frontend to create a solution for a bank’s real estate operations.
📊 Data Analysis: Cleaning and analyzing messy data to uncover insights that matter.

🌱 Always Growing
I’m big on learning—whether it’s exploring new tools, mentoring aspiring developers, or figuring out how to make my code run faster (without just adding more servers).

🛠️ Let’s Build Something Cool!
